NEWS APPLICATION

This is a modern and interactive news application built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Redux Toolkit. The application consumes the News API provided by newsapi.org to fetch and display the latest news articles. With this application, users can stay informed about current events, explore articles from various sources, and read in-depth content on specific topics of interest.

Features
1. Display a list of news articles: Fetches and displays the latest news articles from the News API. Each article is presented with its title, description, author, and published date.

2. Filter articles by source: Provides a user-friendly dropdown or input field that allows users to filter articles based on their preferred news source. When a specific source is selected, the application fetches and displays articles exclusively from that source.

3. Implement pagination: Implements pagination controls to limit the number of articles displayed per page to a maximum of 10. Users can navigate through pages of articles using intuitive previous and next buttons.

4. Implement article details page: When a user clicks on an article, a separate page is displayed with the full content. The article details page includes the title, description, author, published date, and even the article's image if available.

5. Trending Topics: Showcases the current trending topics or popular categories/topics in the news, providing users with quick links to navigate to related articles and explore the latest trends.

6. Editor's Picks: Highlights a curated selection of articles chosen by the editorial team or subject matter experts. These articles are handpicked for their relevance, quality, or significance, offering users access to top-notch content.

7. Subscribe to our newsletter: Includes a section for users to subscribe to the newsletter, enabling them to receive regular updates and personalized recommendations straight to their inbox.
